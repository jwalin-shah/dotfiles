# Plan

Create a step-by-step implementation plan. Consider architecture, data flow, error paths, and invariants.

## Prerequisites

- Wayfinder map read
- Problem statement clear
- Existing code read and understood

## Process

1. Read the wayfinder map and current code
2. Write the design: architecture, data flow, invariants
3. Express invariants as tensor equations
4. List files to touch and the blast radius of each
5. Get grilled (run /grill-me)
6. Revise until grill passes
7. Get captain sign-off

## Output

A plan document with: Problem, Architecture, Invariants (∀ expr), Files, Steps, Edge cases.
